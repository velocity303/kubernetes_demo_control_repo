## site.pp ##

# This file (/etc/puppetlabs/puppet/manifests/site.pp) is the main entry point
# used when an agent connects to a master and asks for an updated configuration.
#
# Global objects like filebuckets and resource defaults should go in this file,
# as should the default node definition. (The default node can be omitted
# if you use the console and don't define any other nodes in site.pp. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.)

## Active Configurations ##

# Disable filebucket by default for all File resources:
#http://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/latest/release_notes.html#filebucket-resource-no-longer-created-by-default
File { backup => false }

# DEFAULT NODE
# Node definitions in this file are merged with node data from the console. See
# http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/language_guide.html#nodes for more on
# node definitions.

# The default node definition matches any node lacking a more specific node
# definition. If there are no other nodes in this file, classes declared here
# will be included in every node's catalog, *in addition* to any classes
# specified in the console for that node.


node default {
  #incude a role on any node that specifies it's role via a trusted fact at provision time
  #https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/lang_facts_and_builtin_vars.html#trusted-facts
  #https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/ssl_attributes_extensions.html#aws-attributes-and-extensions-population-example

  # This is where you can declare classes for all nodes.
  # Example:
  #   class { 'my_class': }
}

#site {
#  example { 'practice':
#    message => "this is my message",
#    nodes   => {
#      Node['node1'] => Example::Origin['practice'],
#      Node['node2'] => Example::Destination['practice'],
#    },
#  }
#  wordpress_app { 'multi':
#    webhead_int => 'eth1',
#    nodes => {
#      Node['node1']  => [
#        Wordpress_app::Database['multi'],
#      ],
#      Node['node2']  => [
#        Wordpress_app::Webhead['multi-0'],
#      ],
#      Node['node3']  => [
#        Wordpress_app::Lb['multi'],
